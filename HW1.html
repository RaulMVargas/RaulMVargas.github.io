        <h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
        <p>I like Wendys, so I'm using this page to show you some of the best menu items and why I think they are good. Below you will find a table with rankings and pictures for various menu items. You will also find a link to their menu</p>

                <td>$5.99</td>
                <td>This is the best item on the menu. Wendy's main form of advertising is that their beef is never frozen, but their chicken is deep fried and comes out very 
                    juicy and with the perfect amount of spice.

                <td>The combination of a juicy patty and the crunchy bacon and melted cheese is enough to satisfy even the most famished of stomachs. Overall a great option and a favorite of mine</td>

                <td>$5.29</td>
                <td>This is Wendy's most basic option but it is still a very juicy and delicious option that doesn't leave you in too much of a food coma. Overall a very solid option</td>
